# Ephemeral Chat Application

This project is a full-stack ephemeral chat application featuring real-time communication, room management, and integration with the Stellar blockchain (Testnet). It consists of a Node.js backend, a React-based frontend, and potentially a Soroban smart contract for on-chain functionalities.

## Features

*   **Real-time Chat:** Powered by Socket.io for instant messaging.
*   **Room Management:** Create and join ephemeral (temporary) or permanent chat rooms, with optional password protection.
*   **Ephemeral Rooms:** Inactive temporary rooms are automatically cleaned up.
*   **Message History:** Retains the last 10 messages per room.
*   **Stellar Integration:**
    *   Utilizes `stellar-sdk` for blockchain interactions.
    *   Frontend integrates with `@stellar/freighter-api` for wallet connectivity.
    *   Likely supports functionalities like account creation, funding (Testnet only via Friendbot), payments, and trustline setup.
*   **User Interface:** Modern UI built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, featuring user avatars (DiceBear) and emoji support.

## Project Structure

*   `ephemeral-chat-backend/` (root directory, implied by `package.json`):
    *   `server.js`: Node.js, Express, and Socket.io backend for chat room management and real-time communication.
    *   `stellar-logic.js`: Utility functions for interacting with the Stellar Test Network.
*   `chat-frontend/`:
    *   A React application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS, providing the user interface.
    *   Connects to the backend via Socket.io and interacts with Stellar via Freighter API.
*   `chat_support_contract/`: (Directory) Contains the Soroban smart contract code, likely for on-chain chat features.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
*   Node.js
*   Express.js
*   Socket.io
*   Stellar SDK

### Frontend
*   React
*   Vite
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Socket.io Client
*   Stellar Freighter API
*   Stellar SDK
*   DiceBear (for avatars)
*   Emoji Picker React

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn

### Installation and Setup

#### 1. Backend (`ephemeral-chat-backend`)

Navigate to the project root directory:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\proje
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 2. Frontend (`chat-frontend`)

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd C:\Users\Acer\Desktop\proje\chat-frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Stellar Network Configuration

The project is configured to use the **Stellar Test Network**. Ensure you have a Stellar wallet (e.g., Freighter) connected to the Testnet for full functionality.

## Soroban Contract

The `chat_support_contract` directory contains the Soroban smart contract. Details on its deployment and interaction would be found within that directory's documentation or code.
